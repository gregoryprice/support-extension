# PRP: MCP Client Agent Refactoring

## Overview
Refactor the MCP (Model Context Protocol) client architecture to work with organization-created agents instead of the hardcoded `customer_support_agent.py`. Each agent with `mcp_enabled=True` will have the ability to connect to the MCP server and call associated tools.

## Current State Analysis
- Hardcoded `customer_support_agent.py` in `app/agents/`
- MCP client in `mcp_client/client.py` 
- Agent model has `mcp_enabled` field at line 270 in `app/models/ai_agent.py`
- Organizations can create custom agents
- Tests reference customer_support_agent directly

## Goals
1. Remove dependency on hardcoded `customer_support_agent.py`
2. Enable MCP functionality for any agent with `mcp_enabled=True`
3. Create default customer support agent during organization setup. Using the prompt coming from the ai_config.yaml file: 

Here is the request body we use to create the agent:

As an example. 

4. Maintain all existing functionality through the new Agent class
5. Ensure all tests pass with new architecture
6. Verify end-to-end MCP functionality
7. Verify all test suite tests pass
8. Verify no errors in docker logs after completion

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis and Setup
**Step 1.1: Analyze Current MCP Integration**
- [ ] Review `mcp_client/client.py` implementation
- [ ] Identify all references to `customer_support_agent.py` in codebase
- [ ] Map MCP tool connections and usage patterns
- [ ] Document current agent-MCP interaction flow

**Step 1.2: Review Agent Model Architecture**
- [ ] Examine `app/models/ai_agent.py` and `mcp_enabled` field
- [ ] Review agent creation and management services
- [ ] Understand organization-agent relationships
- [ ] Verify agent schema supports MCP configuration

### Phase 2: MCP Client Refactoring
**Step 2.1: Refactor MCP Client for Dynamic Agents**
- [ ] Modify `mcp_client/client.py` to accept agent configuration
- [ ] Remove hardcoded customer support agent references
- [ ] Implement agent-based MCP connection logic
- [ ] Add MCP capability checking (`mcp_enabled` validation)

**Step 2.2: Update Agent Service Layer**
- [ ] Modify `app/services/ai_agent_service.py` to handle MCP-enabled agents
- [ ] Add MCP initialization for agents with `mcp_enabled=True`
- [ ] Implement MCP tool discovery and registration per agent
- [ ] Update agent execution flow to include MCP tool calls

### Phase 3: Remove Customer Support Agent Dependencies
**Step 3.1: Remove customer_support_agent.py**
- [ ] Delete `app/agents/customer_support_agent.py`
- [ ] Remove imports and references in all service files
- [ ] Update any hardcoded agent instantiation
- [ ] Clean up configuration references

**Step 3.2: Update Organization Setup**
- [ ] Modify organization creation to auto-create customer support agent
- [ ] Ensure default agent has `mcp_enabled=True`
- [ ] Configure default agent with appropriate MCP tools
- [ ] Update organization setup tests

### Phase 4: Test Infrastructure Updates
**Step 4.1: Update Unit Tests**
- [ ] Fix `tests/test_ai_agents.py` to use new Agent class
- [ ] Update `tests/test_ai_agents_simple.py` references
- [ ] Modify any tests importing `customer_support_agent`
- [ ] Update mocking and fixture creation

**Step 4.2: Update Integration Tests**
- [ ] Fix `tests/test_integration_comprehensive.py`
- [ ] Update `tests/test_mcp_server.py` for dynamic agent testing
- [ ] Modify API endpoint tests using agents
- [ ] Update WebSocket protocol tests if needed

**Step 4.3: Update API Tests**
- [ ] Fix `tests/test_api_endpoints.py` agent references
- [ ] Update chat and conversation tests
- [ ] Modify agent endpoint tests
- [ ] Update authentication tests if affected

### Phase 5: Validation and Testing
**Step 5.1: Run Complete Test Suite**
- [ ] Execute `poetry run pytest` and ensure all tests pass
- [ ] Fix any failing tests related to agent changes
- [ ] Verify test coverage remains adequate
- [ ] Run Docker-based tests: `docker compose exec app poetry run pytest`

**Step 5.2: Docker Services Validation**
- [ ] Start all services: `docker compose up -d`
- [ ] Check service health endpoints
- [ ] Inspect Docker logs for errors: `docker logs <container-name>`
- [ ] Verify MCP server connectivity and tool registration

**Step 5.3: End-to-End MCP Functionality Testing**
**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **Customer Support Agent Creation**
   - [ ] Verify customer support agent is auto-created during org setup
   - [ ] Confirm agent has `mcp_enabled=True`
   - [ ] Validate agent is properly configured with MCP tools

2. **Thread Creation and Messaging**
   - [ ] Create a new thread with the customer support agent
   - [ ] Send a help message requiring MCP tool usage
   - [ ] Verify thread creation and message handling

3. **MCP Tool Access**
   - [ ] Confirm agent can connect to MCP server
   - [ ] Verify agent calls appropriate tools (e.g., "get all tickets", "check system health")
   - [ ] Validate tool discovery and registration

4. **Tool Call Recording and Response**
   - [ ] Verify tool calls are recorded in message history
   - [ ] Confirm MCP server processes tool calls correctly
   - [ ] Validate agent receives tool responses
   - [ ] Ensure agent provides meaningful response using tool data

### Phase 6: Documentation and Cleanup
**Step 6.1: Update Documentation**
- [ ] Update README.md if affected
- [ ] Modify API documentation for agent endpoints
- [ ] Update architecture documentation
- [ ] Document new MCP-agent integration pattern

**Step 6.2: Final Validation**
- [ ] Run full test suite one final time
- [ ] Perform manual testing of key workflows
- [ ] Verify Docker deployment works correctly
- [ ] Confirm no regression in existing functionality

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All tests pass (`poetry run pytest`)
- [ ] Docker services start without errors
- [ ] Customer support agent auto-creation works
- [ ] MCP tools are accessible by enabled agents
- [ ] End-to-end agent-MCP interaction functions correctly
- [ ] No references to `customer_support_agent.py` remain in codebase

## Risk Mitigation
- Comprehensive testing at each phase
- Docker logs monitoring for service health
- Rollback plan if critical functionality breaks

## Technical Notes
- Preserve existing MCP server functionality
- Maintain agent isolation and security
- Ensure MCP connections are properly managed
- Handle agent creation/deletion with MCP state cleanup
- Consider performance implications of dynamic MCP connections

## Estimated Timeline
- Phase 1-2: Analysis and core refactoring (Priority 1)
- Phase 3: Dependency removal (Priority 1) 
- Phase 4-5: Testing and validation (Priority 1)
- Phase 6: Documentation and cleanup (Priority 2)
